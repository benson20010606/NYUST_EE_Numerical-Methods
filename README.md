# NYUST_EE_Numerical Methods
##Course Introduction:Numerical methods refer to mathematical approaches that are often implemented with computer programs to solve engineering or scientific problems. Various fields adopt numerical methods such as regression analysis of data trending and predictions, assessments of physical characteristics of circuits, and torque required for electric motor control, to name a few. Such methods deal with problems of certain complexity by coming up with approximate solutions, especially when exact solutions can hardly be obtained or cannot be represented in rational numbers. The main gist of this course is to familiarize students with the methodology of finding, under a certain amount of processing time, approximate solutions within reasonable errors of estimation.    

##NM2  
Apply the bisection, false position, and simple fixedpoint iteration methods to solve equations  
- $$ x-sin(x)-3=0$$  
- $\ x^2-tanh(x)-x*ln(x)-2=0$  
Display the root and the number of iterations of each method for comparison
